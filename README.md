# Daniela Metodieva's CV

Photography has been part of me since I got my first job position as a photo assistant. I was fascinated by the ability to tell stories through pictures. So I started experimenting with some personal ideas of photo projects.

After some time I gained wish to obtain more professional know-how on how pictures can be improved. Luckily, I got the chance to start working on variety of projects as a retoucher. That experience helped me to improve my technical skills to a world-class level. Ever since, Photoshop gives wings to my desire of doing creative and well-thought-out photos. And the outcome always brings happiness to people I work with.

Today, I feel confident enough to have individual approach to every single project that I work on and no matter if it’s mine or not, I always do my work with passion and attention to detail. Retouching is my superpower to make the world a better place. And it’s also the reason of my desire to travel around the globe, looking for new opportunities and sharing my experience with other retouchers.
